### Troubleshooting
If you are running an ESL/self-hosted version of OU Campus (i.e., your OU Campus server domain is something other than _omniupdate.com_), then you will likely encounter a certificate error when trying to install this gadget.

To resolve this, your server administrator will need to add the [Let's Encrypt intermediate certificate(s)](https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/) to your Java keystore (you'll need to install at least the Letâ€™s Encrypt Authority X1 certificate, but it's probably best to install X2 as well).

To add the certificates, just use the Java keytool app:
```
keytool -import -trustcacerts -keystore /path/to/oucampus/keystore -alias letsencryptX1 -file /path/to/lets-encrypt-x1-cross-signed.pem

keytool -import -trustcacerts -keystore /path/to/oucampus/keystore -alias letsencryptX2 -file /path/to/lets-encrypt-x2-cross-signed.pem
```

## Installing and running locally
This gadget requires a NodeJS back-end to handle the core functionality. To install, run
```
git clone https://github.com/lashkari/gadget-devtools.git

cd gadget-devtools

npm install

npm run dev
```
